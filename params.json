  "body": "# Wraeclast-Online\r\nCurrently in first Alpha version, \r\nWraeclast-Online is a Proof of Concept for bringing any website into Path of Exile _pseudo_ in-game.\r\n\r\nThis is achieved by using JavaFX's WebView contained in an \"undecorated\" window.\r\nThe example below loads this url: https://poe-trademacro.github.io/awesome.html\r\n\r\n![cappp1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/75921/19652016/c72baec2-9a41-11e6-8721-e8a3cb4b10c5.jpg)\r\n\r\nHotkey `v` is used to toggle the Wraeclast-Online Browser (**WOB**). This hotkey is global like in AutoHotKey (AHK).\r\nThe Window can be dragged by holding `alt` and drag by mouse. \r\nA system tray is provided, double click to open. Right click for options. You can set a different url here.\r\n\r\nOn the commandline, you can also set the default url to be used:\r\n\r\n    java -jar poe-wol-0.1.jar http://reddit.com/r/pathofexile\r\n    \r\nOn the sample awesome.html, you'll find a couple of useful callbacks:\r\n \r\n * onJavaLoadSucceed - this is called when WOB has finished loading the page, the bridge object is passed\r\n * onPoEItemCopy - called to provide the clipboard data, will be moved over to bridge\r\n * bridge.setSize(w, h) - call this to resize WOB\r\n * bridge.exit - force exit WOB\r\n\r\n![cappp2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/75921/19652015/c72a8a06-9a41-11e6-8be9-214a9454cfe2.jpg)\r\n\r\nI'm hoping to bring useful functionality like:\r\n \r\n  * Damage/Aura calculators\r\n  * Build Guide explorer\r\n  * Items for Trade Search\r\n  * Uniques Viewer\r\n  * The most useful wiki pages\r\n  * Beginner Guide\r\n  * Features that use the poe client log.txt\r\n  * Features that use the clipboard data\r\n\r\nWraeclast-Online is fan made and is not affiliated with Grinding Gear Games.
